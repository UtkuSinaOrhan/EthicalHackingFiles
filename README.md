!!!“for educational purposes only”!!!    This repository contains the necessary files from the ethical hacking course I took from Atil Samancioglu.
It may be dangerous to run on your own device. According to Atil you should run it on a virtual machine.
I used PyCharm as IDE and Kali Linux as OS to write the code.
