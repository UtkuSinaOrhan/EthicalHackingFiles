# ðŸ”’ Important Note:
# The iptables rules below redirect HTTP and DNS traffic to the local machine.
# These commands must be run in the root terminal (with sudo), and are required 
# for packet interception on certain ports (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).

# Redirect HTTP traffic (port 80) to local port 10000 (e.g., for tools like sslstrip)
# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 10000

# Redirect DNS traffic (port 53) to local port 53 (for DNS spoofing or sniffing)
# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --destination-port 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port 53

"""
This script is used to display raw data transmitted within HTTP requests 
(such as usernames and passwords).

Since HTTPS traffic is encrypted, it cannot be directly viewed using this method.

The `iptables` rules redirect traffic to the local machine, enabling sniffing 
(commonly used in MITM attack scenarios).

Such analysis should only be performed in authorized test environments. 
Otherwise, it may lead to legal consequences.
